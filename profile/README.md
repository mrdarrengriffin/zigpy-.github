# Zigpy
The Zigpy organization and its associated libraries implement a complete Zigbee stack
in Python, allowing you to communicate with consumer Zigbee devices. It encompasses
radio libraries, standards, basic device communication libraries, and application-level
code to communicate with off-the-shelf devices.

Its main user is Home Assistant's [ZHA integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/).
